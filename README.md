# HAVV-analysis

The Social Security Administration provides an Open Government Initiative page with a section about the [Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) Transactions by State](https://www.ssa.gov/open/havv/).

** What is HAVA?**

The [Help America Vote Act of 2002, P.L. 107-252 (HAVA)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ252/pdf/PLAW-107publ252.pdf) requires States to verify the information of newly registered voters for Federal elections. Each State must establish a computerized State-wide voter registration list and verify new voter information with the State’s Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA).

The States are required to verify the driver’s license number against the state MVA database. Only in situations where no driver’s license exists should the states verify the last four digits of the new voter registrant’s Social Security Number (SSN).

The State submits the last digits of the SSN, name, and date of birth to the MVA for verification with SSA. In addition, SSA is required to report whether its records indicate that the registrant is deceased.
